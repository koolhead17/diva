Build an analytics dashboard from functions that return matplotlib figures, pandas dataframes/series, arrays, text, raw HTML, or any data type
of your choosing. If you want your functions to take parameters, like the date range, then diy dashboard can generate HTML widgets to allow the
user to specify. There are built in widgets for common data types (integer, float, string, etc.), HTML form widgets (combo boxes, selection lists, etc.),
as well as many widgets specialized for selecting the date and time (date range, date-time).

Want to convert your custom data type to a report? The library allows you do this by simply writing a function that takes that data type and 
returns raw HTML. Want to create a custom widget? That is easy, too.
