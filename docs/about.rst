About
*******

I made this library as a hobby project. I did not design it to fill some seething void in the space of existing tools. There exist alternatives. I simply thought it would be interesting to make. Nonetheless, please let me know if you find it useful. I'm currently a 3rd-year university student studying Computer Science, and I'll likely be working on homework rather than this project, unless there is reasonable demand for improvements.
