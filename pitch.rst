Diva is a Python library for creating interactive web analytics dashboards. It supports popular analytics libraries like matplotlib, pandas, and bokeh.

The example below will serve a webpage where you can interact with the decorated functions ``foo`` and ``bar``. In this case, the pandas Series objects are converted to HTML tables for browser display. Please see the `demo server <https://fizznow.com>`_ and the User's Guide for more details.
